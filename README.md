Inspired (very heavily) by [vscode-pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets) created by [Anthony Shaw](https://github.com/tonybaloney).

## Features
- A pet that walks around, sits, follows you, interacts with you, basically a fwend
- Pet variants: 5 cats, bunny, chicken, axolotl, hedgehog, 5 dogs
- Pet scale setting, to adjust the size of your pet

## How to use

- After installation, you'll find a pet icon on the right toolbar of your IDE, click on it to open the tool window
- To change the pet variant, go to Preferences > Tools > Pets, and select a pet variant (see screenshot below)
